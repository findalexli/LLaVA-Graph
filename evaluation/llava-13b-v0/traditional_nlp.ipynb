The results of the experiment show that the folklore solution is optimal in this case, since there is no migration necessary and the table can be initialized large enough to make long search distances very improbable. The large discrepancy between the folklore solution and all previous growable hash tables is what motivated the authors to work with growable hash tables in the first place. As shown in the plot, the authors' growing hash table uaGrow looses about 10% of performance over folklore (9.6× Speedup vs. 8.7×). This performance loss can be explained with some overheads that are necessary for eventually growing the table (e.g. estimating the number of elements). All hash tables that have a reasonable performance (> 50% of folklore) are growable hash tables, which shows that growable hash tables are a viable option for implementing hash tables in practice.\"\n",

This behavior is more clearly observable for the COVCE algorithm because it is closer to reach its maximum violation at this state of the request sequence. On the other hand, the GVOP algorithm still accepts many requests accordingly to its relatively low violation factor at this state. Nevertheless, there is already a clearly visible area in which the GVOP algorithm does not accept any requests, namely the wave troughs. Thus, the closer the maximum violation is approached, the wider this interval of non-accepted requests and accordingly the thinner the interval of accepted requests becomes. This interval is for the COVCE algorithm thinner than for the GVOP algorithm at this state of the execution. Furthermore, the “acceptance interval” gets thinner the more requests are being accepted which is beneficial for both algorithms. These acceptance intervals are noticeable in the zig-zag pattern of the GVOP algorithm in Figure 18. In addition, the difference between the four acceptance ratios is again higher in comparison to the acceptance ratios of the reqsize experiments.

The Fourier series is a mathematical tool used to represent a function in terms of its frequency components, and the accuracy of the approximation depends on the number of terms included in the sum as well as the function's smoothness. In this case, the sum of only 200 terms is not sufficient to capture the essential features of the original function f(x), leading to an inaccurate representation. For a more accurate approximation, a larger number of terms would be required, and in some cases, the infinite series might still not provide a perfect match due to the function's complexity.\"\n",
