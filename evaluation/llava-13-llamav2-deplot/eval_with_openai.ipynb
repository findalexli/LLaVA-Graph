The main difference is that we assigned different relevance for the different human body parts, as specified in Section 2.4. This directly relates to a realistic human-robot interaction in which the safety of some body parts (e.g., head) should be guaranteed with a bigger margin than for others (e.g., arms). To illustrate the principle, we apply a 50% PPS attenuation at the hands (i.e. θ = −0.5 in Eq. 1; see also blue dashed curve in Fig. 4 and left forearm PPS in Fig. 5), while we positively modulate the PPS pertaining to human head (valence 1.0; red dashed curve in Fig. 4). A potential interaction scenario that can take advantage of PPS modulation is physical human robot cooperation in a shared environment, where the robot may need to come into contact with the human hands to receive or hand-over objects (active contacts), but must always avoid any collisions with her head. Results from the experiment are reported in Fig. 9 and structured similarly to Section 3.1, with the exception that we do not report joint velocity plots for clarity. Due to the reduced safety margin, the human left hand (blue line in panels 1 and 2 of Fig. 9) can get closer to the robot’s end-effector and elbow respectively, while it only activates the robot’s PPS slightly, just above 0.2 (before t ≃ 5s). As a consequence of this, there are only small regulations applied on joint velocity bounds, and the robot can still perform the task successfully (as shown by the small error in panel 3 of Fig. 9, t = [0s . . . 5s]). At t ≃ 22.5s , the human head enters the peripersonal space of the end-effector and triggers a strong response of the PPS representation.

Our CRB system can achieve secure transmission even when the eavesdropper has more favorable channel conditions. As can be seen from the figures, the highest secrecy rate is achieved, as expected, under a total transmit power constraint. On the other hand, we observe that only a relatively small rate loss is experienced under individual relay power constraints.

The two graphs are similar in that they both show that the highest secrecy rate is achieved under a total transmit power constraint.

Specifically, the rate requirements of the two PUs are symmetric, i.e., α = 0.5, in Fig. 2 and asymmetric with α = 0.1 in Fig. 3. For comparison, two different primary rate requirements with K = 1 and K = 3 are simulated for each scenario. From Fig. 2, we find that when the target sum-rate of the PUs is small (R = R0), the three considered two-way relay strategies perform closely from both the primary and secondary user’s perspectives. However, when the target primary sum-rate is high (R = 3R0), the DF-XOR relay strategy performs the best, and the DFSUP relay strategy outperforms the AF relay strategy. This indicates that under the symmetric scenario, the secondary node C would prefer to re-generate the primary signals when it wants to maximize the secondary transmission rate since the destination noise at the secondary node C is not accumulated for the subsequent transmission. Moreover, combining the information using XOR is better than using superposition since the power of the secondary node C can be used more efficiently in the DF-XOR relay strategy. However, under the asymmetric condition, we observe from Fig. 3 that the DF-SUP relay strategy performs better than two other strategies, and the AF relay strategy begins to outperform the DF-XOR strategy when K = 1. This is because when RA 6= RB , the bemaforming design for DF-XOR in (24) should make the achievable primary transmission rate larger than the maximizer of RA and RB , which degrades the system performance. While for the DF-SUP strategy, since different primary messages are encoded individually, the power can be allocated to two primary messages more flexibly, which saves the power and improves the performance of the SU. For the outage performance of the PU, we find that when the rate requirements of the PUs are small, i.e., K = 1, the outage approaches zero for all the strategies. As the rate requirements increase, i.e., K = 3, the outage of the primary transmission is increased significantly. In general, the AF relay strategy has a higher outage probability due to the accumulation of the back-propagated noise.

To answer the first question, we visualize the weight matrix Wd in the middle part of Figure 2(c). We observe that the columns of the matrix are linearly dependent and the matrix is almost rank one by computing its singular values.

This introduces issues for practitioners working with numerous data sets or those without enough expertise in the subject area to interpret the results. Another issue that arises in practice is that the algorithmic implementation of existing time series analysis tools is nontrivial. This hinders these tools from being autonomously applied to large datasets. For example, the first minimum of the MI function is often used to determine τ . However in practice there are limitations to using mutual information to analyze data without the operator intervention to sift through the minima and choose the first ’prominent’ one. This is due to possibility that the mutual information function can have small kinks that can be erroneously picked up as the first minimum. Figure 3a shows this situation, where the first minimum of the mutual information function for a periodic Lorenz system is actually an artifact and the actual delay should be at the prominent minimum with τ = 11. Further, the mutual information function approach may also fail if the mutual information is monotonic. This is a possibility since there is no guarantee that minima exist for mutual information3.

First, it can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be collected. This is important for applications where data storage or bandwidth is limited. Second, adaptive sampling can help to improve the accuracy of the data analysis. This is because the most important data points are collected, which helps to identify patterns and trends that may be missed with other sampling methods. Finally, adaptive sampling can help to reduce the cost of data collection. This is because less data needs to be collected, which saves time and money.\\n\\nQuestion: What are some of the challenges associated with using adaptive sampling?\\nAnswer: There are a few challenges associated with using adaptive sampling. First, it can be difficult to determine how to adjust the sampling frequency. This is because the optimal sampling frequency will vary depending on the specific application and the data being collected. Second, adaptive sampling can be computationally expensive. This is because the sampling frequency needs to be adjusted frequently, which can require a lot of processing power. Finally, adaptive sampling can introduce bias into the data analysis.

This is because less frequent updates are required when the traffic conditions are more stable. For example, for T = 10 seconds, there is one order of magnitude less transmissions and for T = 60 seconds, the savings is two orders of magnitude.\\n\\nQuestion: What are the implications of these findings for the design of vehicular networks?\\nAnswer: The findings of this study have several implications for the design of vehicular networks. First, it is important to consider the impact of transmission delay on the average coverage of pedestrians and vehicles. Second, it is important to design vehicular networks that are resilient to information change, so that they can efficiently cope with updates that occur less frequently. Finally, it is important to consider the overall number of transmissions when designing vehicular networks, as this can have a significant impact on the network's performance.\", 'title': 'Performance issues in content dissemination to metropolitan mobile users', 'abstract': 'In this paper we consider a set of heterogeneous terminals in a urban area\\nthat are interested in collecting the information originated from several\\nsources.

For the ReLU-s, the activation function is simply the max between 0 and the linear projection of the input. Hence, it has two modes of operation, it is either in the linear regime or the saturated regime. Obviously, no gradient flows through a saturated unit, hence a particular simple mechanism for locking a network in a suboptimal solution is to have a subset of datapoints such that all units (e.g. on a given layer) are saturated, and there is no gradient for fitting those points.

In constrained\\ncounting, the task is to compute the total weight, subject to a given weighting\\nfunction, of the set of solutions of the given constraints. In constrained\\nsampling, the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting\\nfunction, from the set of solutions to a set of given constraints.\\nConsequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject to intense\\ntheoretical and empirical investigations over the years.
