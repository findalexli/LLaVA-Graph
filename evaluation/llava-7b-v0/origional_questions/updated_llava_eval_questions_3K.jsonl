{"text": "The figure shows the results of evaluating five comparison operators on five scenarios of two random variables with different distributions. The left column of the figure shows the five scenarios, which are combinations of instances of various distributions including uniform, Gaussian and beta distributions. The right column of the figure shows the absolute error of the comparison operators for each scenario and for different numbers of samples. The comparison operators in the legend are ranked according to their absolute error bound with the maximal number of samples N = 106.\n\nThe first scenario is a comparison of two uniform random variables with different means and variances. The second scenario is a comparison of two Gaussian random variables with different means and variances. The third scenario is a comparison of two beta random variables with different parameters. The fourth scenario is a comparison of two random variables with different distributions. The fifth scenario is a comparison of two random variables with the same distribution.\n\nThe results show that the comparison operators perform differently on different scenarios. The best performing operator is the empirical comparison operator, which has the smallest absolute error for all scenarios. The worst performing operator is the control variate comparison operator, which has the largest absolute error for all scenarios. The other operators perform in between these two extremes.\n\nThe results also show that the number of samples has a significant impact on the absolute error of the comparison operators. The absolute error decreases as the number of samples increases. This is because the comparison operators are based on statistical estimates, and the estimates become more accurate as the number of samples increases.\n\nThe figure provides a comprehensive overview of the performance of the five comparison operators on five scenarios of two random variables with different distributions. The results can be used to select the most appropriate comparison operator for a given application.", "category": "conv", "image": "1910.08413v1-Figure3-1.png", "question_id": 284}

The third plot shows the structure factor for a uniform system.\n\nThe results show that the central approximation (k = \u221e) can cause spurious oscillations in the density for inhomogeneous systems, while the upwind approximation (k = 0) can lead to an artificial fluctuation dampening. The hybrid approximation (k = 3) provides a good compromise between accuracy and stability, and is therefore recommended for use in FH simulations.", "category": "conv", "image": "1910.05067v2-Figure1-1.png", "question_id": 2936}
