In essence, this approach considers\\nthe scenario when the channel failure probabilities for different clients are\\nof the same order, and asymptotically approach zero. We thus proceed to\\ndetermine the asymptotically optimal policy: in a two-client scenario, we show\\nthat the asymptotically optimal policy is a \"modified least time-to-go\" policy,\\nwhich is intuitively appealing and easily implementable; in the general\\nmulti-client scenario, we are led to an SN policy, and we develop an algorithm\\nof low computational complexity to obtain it. Simulation results show that the\\nresulting policies perform well even in the pre-asymptotic regime with moderate\\nfailure probabilities.', 'q_a_pairs': [['What is the purpose of the graph?', 'The graph compares the performance of different scheduling policies in a two-client scenario.

Therefore, although the model appears to under-estimate some hypotheses at low copy rates, it actually smears probability mass in the hypothesis space.

This is because the model is smooth and can assign non-negligible probability mass to partial copies that are not present in the training data.\\n\\nQuestion: What are the implications of these findings?\\nAnswer: These findings have implications for the use of the model in practice. For example, if the model is used to translate a text from one language to another, it may be more likely to produce an exact copy of the source text if the training data contains a lot of copy noise. This could lead to errors in the translation.\\n\\nQuestion: What are some possible solutions to this problem?\\nAnswer: One possible solution is to use a model that is not as smooth. This would reduce the probability of the model assigning non-negligible probability mass to partial copies that are not present in the training data.

Specifically, the rate requirements of the two PUs are symmetric, i.e., Î± = 0.5, in Fig. 2 and asymmetric with Î± = 0.1 in Fig. 3. For comparison, two different primary rate requirements with K = 1 and K = 3 are simulated for each scenario. From Fig. 2, we find that when the target sum-rate of the PUs is small (R = R0), the three considered two-way relay strategies perform closely from both the primary and secondary userâs perspectives. However, when the target primary sum-rate is high (R = 3R0), the DF-XOR relay strategy performs the best, and the DFSUP relay strategy outperforms the AF relay strategy. This indicates that under the symmetric scenario, the secondary node C would prefer to re-generate the primary signals when it wants to maximize the secondary transmission rate since the destination noise at the secondary node C is not accumulated for the subsequent transmission. Moreover, combining the information using XOR is better than using superposition since the power of the secondary node C can be used more efficiently in the DF-XOR relay strategy. However, under the asymmetric condition, we observe from Fig. 3 that the DF-SUP relay strategy performs better than two other strategies, and the AF relay strategy begins to outperform the DF-XOR strategy when K = 1. This is because when RA 6= RB , the bemaforming design for DF-XOR in (24) should make the achievable primary transmission rate larger than the maximizer of RA and RB , which degrades the system performance. While for the DF-SUP strategy, since different primary messages are encoded individually, the power can be allocated to two primary messages more flexibly, which saves the power and improves the performance of the SU. For the outage performance of the PU, we find that when the rate requirements of the PUs are small, i.e., K = 1, the outage approaches zero for all the strategies. As the rate requirements increase, i.e., K = 3, the outage of the primary transmission is increased significantly. In general, the AF relay strategy has a higher outage probability due to the accumulation of the back-propagated noise.

This is due to possibility that the mutual information function can have small kinks that can be erroneously picked up as the first minimum. Figure 3a shows this situation, where the first minimum of the mutual information function for a periodic Lorenz system is actually an artifact and the actual delay should be at the prominent minimum with Ï = 11. Further, the mutual information function approach may also fail if the mutual information is monotonic. This is a possibility since there is no guarantee that minima exist for mutual information3.

Moreover, since our model is smooth, it can assign non-negligible probability mass to partial copies5 which are not present in the training data. When we consider both partial and exact copies, the model correctly reproduces the amount of copy noise present in the training data.

First, it can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be collected. This is important for applications where data storage or bandwidth is limited. Second, adaptive sampling can help to improve the accuracy of the data analysis. This is because the most important data points are collected, which helps to identify patterns and trends that may be missed with other sampling methods.

First, it can be difficult to determine how to adjust the sampling frequency. This is because the optimal sampling frequency will vary depending on the specific application and the data being collected. Second, adaptive sampling can be computationally expensive. This is because the sampling frequency needs to be adjusted frequently, which can require a lot of processing power. Finally, adaptive sampling can introduce bias into the data analysis.

This is due to possibility that the mutual information function can have small kinks that can be erroneously picked up as the first minimum. Figure 3a shows this situation, where the first minimum of the mutual information function for a periodic Lorenz system is actually an artifact and the actual delay should be at the prominent minimum with Ï = 11. Further, the mutual information function approach may also fail if the mutual information is monotonic. This is a possibility since there is no guarantee that minima exist for mutual information3.

The policies differ in the way they prioritize the clients. The PRR policy prioritizes the client with the higher probability of successful transmission, while the MLG policy prioritizes the client with the lower probability of successful transmission.

Figure 9 shows a large discrepancy: at low pnoise the model underestimates the probability of copying (i.e., too few of the produced samples are exact copies of the source), while at high noise levels it overestimates it. Moreover, since our model is smooth, it can assign non-negligible probability mass to partial copies5 which are not present in the training data. When we consider both partial and exact copies, the model correctly reproduces the amount of copy noise present in the training data.

This is because the model is smooth and can assign non-negligible probability mass to partial copies that are not present in the training data.\\n\\nQuestion: What are the implications of these findings?\\nAnswer: These findings have implications for the use of the model in practice. For example, if the model is used to translate a text from one language to another, it may be more likely to produce an exact copy of the source text if the training data contains a lot of copy noise. This could lead to errors in the translation.\\n\\nQuestion: What are some possible solutions to this problem?\\nAnswer: One possible solution is to use a model that is not as smooth. This would reduce the probability of the model assigning non-negligible probability mass to partial copies that are not present in the training data.

This introduces issues for practitioners working with numerous data sets or those without enough expertise in the subject area to interpret the results. Another issue that arises in practice is that the algorithmic implementation of existing time series analysis tools is nontrivial. This hinders these tools from being autonomously applied to large datasets. For example, the first minimum of the MI function is often used to determine Ï . However in practice there are limitations to using mutual information to analyze data without the operator intervention to sift through the minima and choose the first âprominentâ one. This is due to possibility that the mutual information function can have small kinks that can be erroneously picked up as the first minimum. Figure 3a shows this situation, where the first minimum of the mutual information function for a periodic Lorenz system is actually an artifact and the actual delay should be at the prominent minimum with Ï = 11. Further, the mutual information function approach may also fail if the mutual information is monotonic. This is a possibility since there is no guarantee that minima exist for mutual information3.

In constrained\\nsampling, the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting\\nfunction, from the set of solutions to a set of given constraints.\\nConsequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject to intense\\ntheoretical and empirical investigations over the years. Prior work, however,\\noffered either heuristic techniques with poor guarantees of accuracy or\\napproaches with proven guarantees but poor performance in practice.\\n  In this thesis, we introduce a novel hashing-based algorithmic framework for\\nconstrained sampling and counting that combines the classical algorithmic\\ntechnique of universal hashing with the dramatic progress made in combinatorial\\nreasoning tools, in particular, SAT and SMT, over the past two decades. The\\nresulting frameworks for counting (ApproxMC2) and sampling (UniGen) can handle\\nformulas with up to million variables representing a significant boost up from\\nthe prior state of the art tools' capability to handle few hundreds of\\nvariables. If the initial set of constraints is expressed as Disjunctive Normal\\nForm (DNF), ApproxMC is the only known Fully Polynomial Randomized\\nApproximation Scheme (FPRAS) that does not involve Monte Carlo steps. By\\nexploiting the connection between definability of formulas and variance of the\\ndistribution of solutions in a cell defined by 3-universal hash functions, we\\nintroduced an algorithmic technique, MIS, that reduced the size of XOR\\nconstraints employed in the underlying universal hash functions by as much as\\ntwo orders of magnitude.\", 'q_a_pairs': [['What is the purpose of the graph?', 'The graph is used to measure the quality of approximation of the approximate counts returned by ApproxMC2.
