# ðŸŒ‹ LLaVA-Graph: Context-prompted vision-language assistant for explaining scientific graphs
*TLDR: We re-formulate image-caption-generation problem as context-prompted 'explanation' generation problem, which alings models output given (graph, caption) to its first mentioned paragraph. Fine-tuned from LLaVa with 5X more tokens using SciCap *

[[Demo](https://llava.hliu.cc/)]  [[Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Instruct-150K)] [[Model](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/LLaVA-13b-delta-v0)]

## Main Contribution of LLaVA-Graph
- **Caption as context, not as prediction target**. 
    One-third of captions in SciCap are single-sentence (Hsu et al.2023) Many are incomplete sentences(i.e.  "Vary number of objects') or consist of single/multple Nouns ('IIPS', 'Average Travel Time'). Efforts to predict captions from image have not been successful, despite attempts to contexualize the model (Yang, 2023). We theroized that captions are instead excellent prompts as contextting the Large Vision-Language Models. 
- **OCR as additional context (optional)**. 
    ["On the Hidden Mystery of OCR in Large Multimodal Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07895) shows that even most powerful large multimodal models cannot match expert OCR models by large margin. Zero-shot text recognition results ranges  37-61% compared to Supervised SOTA of 85%. This deficincy is particular detrimental to science graphs where text and their location are much more important for humans to read and understand. We added extracted text and bounding boxes when text is detected in figures as part of the contextual prompt. 
- **Paragraph as target**. 
    first-paragraph that mentioned the figure are significantly more informative and carry descriptive and logical explanations, which we hypothezied to aid as ground truth in instructing the LMM to assist users to understand graphs via Chat.
- **Dataset**
    Our training dataset is constructed using SciCap from 290K papers published on Arxiv on topic of CS and ML. Our training corpose is 5X larger than LLaVapre-training dataset (LiON-CC-590K) or 50X larger with OCR features.  


**Usage and License Notices**: The data, code and checkpoint is intended and licensed for research use only. They are also restricted to uses that follow the license agreement of LLaMA, Vicuna and GPT-4.

## LLaVA Weights
We release [LLaVA](https://llava-vl.github.io/) weights as delta weights to comply with the LLaMA model license.
You can add our delta to the original LLaMA weights to obtain the LLaVA weights.

Instructions:

1. Get the original LLaMA weights in the huggingface format by following the instructions [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama).
2. Use the following scripts to get LLaVA weights by applying our delta ([13b-v0](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/LLaVA-13b-delta-v0), [7b-v0](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/LLaVA-7b-delta-v0), [lightning-7B-v1-1](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Lightning-7B-delta-v1-1)). It will automatically download delta weights from our Hugging Face account.

### LLaVA-13B
This conversion command needs around 60 GB of CPU RAM.
```bash
python3 -m llava.model.apply_delta \
    --base /path/to/llama-13b \
    --target /output/path/to/LLaVA-13B-v0 \
    --delta liuhaotian/LLaVA-13b-delta-v0
```

    --delta liuhaotian/LLaVA-7b-delta-v0
```


### LLaVA pretrained projector weights
The initial release is pretrained on [LLaVA-filtered CC3M 595K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-CC3M-Pretrain-595K) with 1 epoch.  The pretrained weights are released [here](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/LLaVA-13b-pretrain-projector-v0).

You may perform instruction tuning on our pretrained checkpoints, by using our [visual instruction tuning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Instruct-150K) data following the instructions [here](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA#fine-tuning-with-local-gpus).

## Serving

### Web UI

#### Launch a controller
```Shell
python -m llava.serve.controller --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000
```

#### Launch a model worker
```Shell
python -m llava.serve.model_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port 40000 --worker http://localhost:40000 --model-path ./checkpoints/LLaVA-13B-v0 --multi-modal
```
Wait until the process finishes loading the model and you see "Uvicorn running on ...".

#### Launch a model worker (Multiple GPUs, when GPU VRAM <= 24GB)

If your the VRAM of your GPU is less than 24GB (e.g., RTX 3090, RTX 4090, etc.), you may try running it with multiple GPUs.

```Shell
python -m llava.serve.model_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port 40000 --worker http://localhost:40000 --model-path ./checkpoints/LLaVA-13B-v0 --multi-modal --num-gpus 2
```
Wait until the process finishes loading the model and you see "Uvicorn running on ...".

#### Launch a gradio web server.
```Shell
python -m llava.serve.gradio_web_server --controller http://localhost:10000
```
#### You can open your browser and chat with a model now.

### CLI Inference

A starting script for inference with LLaVA without the need of Gradio interface. The current implementation only supports for a single-turn Q-A session, and the interactive CLI is WIP.  This also serves as an example for users to build customized inference scripts.

```Shell
python -m llava.eval.run_llava \
    --model-name /path/to/LLaVA-13B-v0 \
    --image-file "https://llava-vl.github.io/static/images/view.jpg" \
    --query "What are the things I should be cautious about when I visit here?"
```

Example output (varies in different runs):

> When visiting this picturesque location with a serene lake and a wooden pier extending over the water, one should be cautious about various safety aspects. Some important considerations include:
> 
> 1. Ensuring that the pier is structurally sound andstable, as old or weakened pier structures might not support the weight of visitors.
> 2. Being aware of the water depth around the pier and lake, as sudden drop-offs or strong currents may pose a risk to swimmers, boaters, or those who venture too close to the edge.
> 3. Staying vigilant about the presence of wildlife in the area, such as slippery, stealthy fish or other animals that might cause harm or inconvenience.
> 4. Maintaining a safe distance from the water's edge, particularly for children, elderly individuals, or those who are not strong swimmers.
> 5. Following any posted signs or guidelines related to safety and the use of the pier and surrounding areas.
> 
> By considering these safety precautions, visitors can enjoy the natural beauty of the location while minimizing risks and ensuring a safe and pleasant experience.


## Evaluation

### GPT-assisted Evaluation

Our GPT-assisted evaluation pipeline for multimodal modeling is provided for a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities of vision-language models.  Please see our paper for more details.

1. Generate LLaVA responses

```Shell
python model_vqa.py \
    --model-name ./checkpoints/LLaVA-13B-v0 \
    --question-file \
    playground/data/coco2014_val_qa_eval/qa90_questions.jsonl \
    --image-folder \
    /path/to/coco2014_val \
    --answers-file \
    /path/to/answer-file.jsonl
```

2. Evaluate the generated responses.  In our case, [`answer-file-1.jsonl`](./playground/data/coco2014_val_qa_eval/qa90_gpt4_answer.jsonl) is the response generated by text-only GPT-4 (0314), with the context captions/boxes provided.

```Shell
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-***********************************" python eval_gpt_review_visual.py \
    --question playground/data/coco2014_val_qa_eval/qa90_questions.jsonl \
    --context table/caps_boxes_coco2014_val_80.jsonl \
    --answer-list \
    /path/to/answer-file-1.jsonl \
    /path/to/answer-file-2.jsonl \
    --rule table/rule.json \
    --output /path/to/review.json
```

3. Summarize the evaluation results

```Shell
python summarize_gpt_review.py
```




### Code and Hyperparameters
We fine-tune the model using the code from [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat). We use a similar set of hyperparameters as Vicuna in finetuning.  Both hyperparameters used in pretraining and finetuning are provided below.

1. Pretraining

| Hyperparameter | Global Batch Size | Learning rate | Epochs | Max length | Weight decay |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| LLaVA-13B | 128 | 2e-3 | 1 | 2048 | 0 |

2. Finetuning

| Hyperparameter | Global Batch Size | Learning rate | Epochs | Max length | Weight decay |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| LLaVA-13B | 32 | 2e-5 | 3 | 2048 | 0 |

### Fine-tuning with Local GPUs
LLaVA is trained on 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB memory with the following code. To train on fewer GPUs, you can reduce the `per_device_train_batch_size` and increase the `gradient_accumulation_steps` accordingly to keep the global batch size the same.
