  You are an AI visual assistant that can analyze a graph in a scientific paper. You are provided with the OCR-extracted text, the caption of the figure, and the first paragraph that mentioned the figure.

  Your task is to use information from all these provided sources to create a plausible question about the graph, and then provide a detailed answer.

  You should aim to ask complex questions that go beyond a simple description of the graph. The answer to such questions should require understanding the graph data, and then reasoning based on background knowledge or interpretation. You should aim to provide guides and scholarly perspectives based on the graph's data and context.

  Avoid directly revealing specific details in the question. Make the question challenging in a way that the user needs to first reason about the graph data and the context they have derived from the accompanying paper.

  Instead of referring to specific labels or points in the graph while asking a question or giving an answer, explain the graph using natural language. Include details like data trends, prominent points, and relationships between different data sets visualized in the graph.

  When using the information from the OCR-extracted text, caption and first paragraph to explain the graph, avoid stating that these are your sources. Always answer as if you are directly interpreting the graph according to your AI comprehension, understanding and reasoning. Regarding the format of the given input: the following context described the image:  "from": "human", "value": contains OCR extracted text listed, and 'Figure (integer) caption of the image'."from: gpt value: contains the first paragraph in the text that mentioned the figure. 

  Examples:
  Example 1:
  User: The following context described the image:  "from": "human", "value": contains OCR extracted text listed, and 'Figure (integer) caption of the image'."from: gpt value: contains the first paragraph in the text that mentioned the figure. 
  Assistant: Question: How does the percentage of groups that have successfully acquired a timetable change along with fluctuations in the group size, and based on the graph, which areas are more likely to have successful timetable allocation?

  Answer: The graph presents a relationship between group size and the success rate in acquiring a timetable. It highlights a trend where as group size increases, the likelihood of acquiring a timetable seems to diminish. This is the overall pattern across all the regions, including Scotland, Central UK, and South and Central UK.

In general, one can solve an optimization problem to find the optimal choice of power level assignments that maximizes the achievable sum-rate. We have performed numerical analysis for this optimization problem. Figure 7 shows the gap between our proposed achievable scheme and the outer-bounds in Corollary 1 at (a) SNR = 20dB, (b) SNR = 40dB, and (c) SNR = 60dB, for CFB = 10 bits. In fact through our numerical analysis, we can see that the gap is at most 4, 5, and 5.5 bits/sec/Hz for the given values of SNR, respectively. Note that sharp points in Figure 7 are due to the change of achievability scheme for different values of INR as described before." }
  Answer:

  Question: What is the relationship between the gap between the achievable scheme and the outer-bounds in Corollary 1, and the SNR and INR values?

  Answer: The graph shows the gap between the achievable scheme and the outer-bounds in Corollary 1 at (a) SNR = 20dB, (b) SNR = 40dB, and (c) SNR = 60dB, for CFB = 10 bits. The gap is at most 4, 5, and 5.5 bits/sec/Hz for the given values of SNR, respectively. The sharp points in the graph are due to the change of achievability scheme for different values of INR.
